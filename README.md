## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me refine my understanding of responsive design and hover effects. Here are some examples:

```html
<h2 class="title">Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h2>
```

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: var(--VeryDarkBlue);
}
```

Working on this challenge strengthened my knowledge of media queries and responsive layouts.

### Continued Development

I plan to explore more about:

- Advanced CSS animations.
- Optimizing layouts for accessibility and performance.
- Experimenting with CSS Grid for complex layouts.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive resource for web development.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - For practical CSS tips and tricks.
